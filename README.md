# Brad's Dotfiles

These are all the things that I need in a terminal to be productive. Well,
mostly all the things I guess. The most important part really is the VIM
config. Where would I be without it?

## Installing

Pretty straight forward.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:bradhe/dotfiles.git brads-dotfiles
# ...
$ cd ./brads-dotfiles
$ ./install.sh
```
